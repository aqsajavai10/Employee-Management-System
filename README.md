# Employee Management System (EMS)

## Overview

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee records efficiently. It allows administrators and HR personnel to perform CRUD operations on employees, departments, and roles, while employees can view and update their profiles.

This project follows a **Spring Framework (backend)** + **React (frontend)** architecture, making it modular, scalable, and user-friendly.
